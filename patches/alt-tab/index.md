* `tabCycleKey` - If this key is hit the alt-tab program moves one position forward in clients stack. This key must be the same as key that is used to active function altTabStart
* `tabEndKey`- If this key is hit the while you're in the alt-tab mode, you'll be returned to previous state (alt-tab mode turned off and your window of origin will be selected)
* `tabMoveBackKey` - If this key is being hold while hitting tabCycleKey you'll move in stack of windows backwards
* `tabPosY` - Tab position on Y axis, 0 = bottom, 1 = center, 2 = top
